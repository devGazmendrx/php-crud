## PHPCrud - What is this?
A basic OOP approach with Core PHP to communicate with your DB using PDO :)

## How do i use this?
You can checkout for direct examples on how to use the DB object in index.php file;

For the actual backend communication code you can check classes/DB/DB.class.php for the main DB object, 
and classes/DB/DBHelper.class.php for the helper class that works for the main DB object.
